# README

Because json files don't accept comments, we put comments about the jsonschema
here.

## Terms

TODO: Make "id" field of "terms" required. We can't make it required now,
      without adding a lot of transition code in order to support what is
      on stage. It will be much easier to add the requirement after the CTSA
      meeting.
