      Research Data Management (RDM) platforms make it possible to preserve and share, support reproducibility, and empower reuse of collaborative research activities and outputs.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>InvenioRDM</b> enables organizations to securely house research products and <b>make them discoverable, shareable, and citable</b> -- from publications and presentations to datasets, software, lay summaries, policy documents, and guidelines. <b>InvenioRDM</b> is being developed as part of a large, multi-organization collaboration in partnership with the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), birthplace of the World Wide Web and developers of the Zenodo RDM for the European community. Together we are working to build a wide range of features that can help power biomedical research and support data sharing, innovation, knowledge dissemination, and interdisciplinary collaboration.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our work is driven by user needs and informed by best practices and standards, including those that help define Next Generation Repositories as a foundation for a distributed, globally-networked infrastructure for scholarly communication, discovery, and innovation.
