    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      Research Data Management (RDM) platforms play a critical role in the research ecosystem to preserve and share, enable reproducibility, and empower reuse of collaborative research activities and outputs.
    </p>
    <p>
      InvenioRDM makes it possible to empower organizations to securely house research products and make them discoverable, sharable, and citable -- from publications and presentations to datasets, software, lay summaries, policy documents, and workflows. InvenioRDM is being developed as part of a large, multi-organization collaboration in partnership with the <a href="https://home.cern/">European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)</a>, developers of <a href="https://zenodo.org">Zenodo</a> for the European community.  Together, we are working to build a wide range of features that can help power biomedical research and support data sharing, accessibility, innovation, and interdisciplinary collaboration.
